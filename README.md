Wildlife Conservation Using AI/ML
Overview
This project leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to analyze wildlife data and support conservation efforts. By predicting animal lifespan and conservation status, the system provides data-driven insights that can help prioritize at-risk species and inform strategic conservation planning.
Dataset
- Animal_Dataset.csv containing 196 unique animals with 16+ features
- Includes attributes such as lifespan, weight, height, speed, habitat, and conservation status
Objectives
- Predict Animal Lifespan using advanced regression models
- Classify Conservation Status to assess species vulnerability
- Develop AI-driven insights for effective conservation strategies
Tools & Technologies
